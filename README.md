# Gitonga Isaac

I’m a software engineer focused on building **robust systems**, **performance-aware frontends**, and **clean backend architectures**.

I care deeply about *how things work* — from UI rendering and animation pipelines, down to data modeling, system boundaries, and execution trade-offs. My work sits at the intersection of **engineering discipline**, **clarity of design**, and **long-term maintainability**.

---

## What I Work On

- **System design & architecture**
  - Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) patterns
  - Domain-driven design and layered architectures
  - Repository & Unit of Work patterns
- **Web engineering**
  - Performance-first frontends
  - Scroll-driven and interaction-based storytelling
  - Framework-agnostic architecture when it makes sense
- **Data & infrastructure**
  - PostgreSQL (including JSONB-heavy designs)
  - Type-safe data layers
  - Pragmatic DevOps and deployment workflows

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- TypeScript
- HTML5 / CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP (ScrollTrigger, timelines, motion systems)

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express
- Next.js (App Router, BFF architecture)
- Prisma ORM

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL (past experience)

**Tooling & Infra**
- Vite
- ESBuild
- Vercel
- Git / GitHub
- Linux (Ubuntu)

## Philosophy

- Architecture is not about overengineering — it’s about **making change cheap**
- Performance is a feature, not an afterthought
- Motion should **serve clarity**, not decoration
- Strong abstractions earn their keep over time
- Understand fundamentals first, then scale complexity deliberately

---

## Selected Work

- **Personal Portfolio** – performance-focused, animation-driven static site  
- **Government Services Platform** – multi-agency workflows, PostgreSQL + JSONB, BFF architecture  
- **Marketing Agency Website** – scroll-based storytelling and brand-focused motion systems

*I use GitHub to ship real systems, explore architectural ideas, and refine engineering judgment — not just to collect stars.*
